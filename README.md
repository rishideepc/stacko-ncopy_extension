# StackO'n Copy


Welcome to my VS Code extension!

## Welcome to My VS Code Extension

We developers scout around Stack Overflow for any and all kinds of errors in our code. It is our one-stop destination for code debugging. Consequently, I developed the StackO'n Copy VS Code extension that allows you to search for solutions to your missing semicolon :")

This extension adds some amazing features to your Visual Studio Code editor that will boost your productivity and make your coding experience smoother. With its powerful tools, you can focus on writing code without worrying about the timely resolution of your errors.


## Features

1. Copy and search for solutions without the need to manually launch a browser.

2. StackO'n Copy handpicks the best possible solution to your problem.


## ðŸš€ Installation and Usage

To use the extension, simply open Visual Studio Code and navigate to the Extensions panel. Search for StackO'n Copy and install it. 

Now when you encounter an error in your code, simply copy the erroneous code fragment and press "ALT+/" for a list of probable solutions on Stack Overflow.

You can also enter "ALT+E" for displaying the most probable solution from Stack Overflow!

Note: Access only v0.0.1 now! v0.0.2 is out of order!
